# StatKani

StatKani provides data visualisations for learners of [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji). It is a companion site to [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/), a website that teaches over 2,000 Kanji and 6,000 words using mnemonics and [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

## Acknowledgements

The wave animation on the landing page was inspired by a similar animation on Amelia Wattenberger's personal site, which I recreated using `visx` and `framer-motion`.
